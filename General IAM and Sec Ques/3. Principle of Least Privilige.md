 - **Containing Breaches**: Even if one account is compromised, limited access minimizes the potential damage. 🔒

### 4. Provide Examples  
- **Corporate Use Case**: 
  - A system administrator uses temporary elevated privileges to install software. 
  - Once the task is complete, the privileges are revoked to avoid unnecessary access. 🛠️
- **Real-World Incident**: 
  - In 2014, hackers exploited excessive privileges in third-party vendor accounts to access Target's network, leading to a major data breach. 
  - Applying PoLP could have contained the attack. 🚨

### 5. Relate to Security Best Practices  
- **Confidentiality**: Ensures sensitive information is only accessible to those who genuinely need it. 🔐  
- **Integrity**: Prevents unauthorized modifications to systems or data. 🛡️  
- **Availability**: Protects resources from unnecessary or malicious interference, ensuring they remain accessible to authorized users. 🌐  
- **Risk Reduction**: Limits the impact of a compromised account by reducing its permissions. 📉
