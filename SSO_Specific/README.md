### **Introduction to Single Sign-On (SSO)**

#### **Definition of Single Sign-On (SSO)**  
Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication method that allows users to access multiple applications or systems with a single set of login credentials. Instead of requiring separate usernames and passwords for each service, SSO streamlines the process by enabling users to log in once and gain access to all authorized systems and applications connected to the SSO solution.

#### **Definition in Layman Terms**  
Imagine having one master key that unlocks every door in your house, your car, your office, and even your locker. You don’t need a separate key for each lock—just one key that works everywhere. In the digital world, SSO acts as this master key, letting you log in once and access all your apps and services without needing to enter your password multiple times.

#### **Hypothetical Example**  
Let’s say you work at a company that uses multiple tools: an email platform, a project management system, and a video conferencing app. Without SSO, you’d need to remember and enter separate login details for Gmail, Trello, and Zoom every time you switch between them. With SSO in place, you log in once through the company’s identity portal, and you’re automatically granted access to all three tools without having to re-enter your credentials. This saves time and reduces the frustration of juggling multiple passwords.

#### **Real-World Example**  
A common example of SSO is Google’s account system. When you sign in to your Google account on Gmail, you’re automatically logged in to other Google services like YouTube, Google Drive, and Google Calendar. This seamless access is possible because Google uses SSO to manage authentication across its ecosystem of services, enhancing user experience while maintaining centralized security controls.
